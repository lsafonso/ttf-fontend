2. **Set up Supabase:**
   - Create a new Supabase project
   - Copy your project URL and anon key
   - Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`

3. **Configure AWS Credentials:**
   - Create an AWS IAM user with Polly permissions
   - Add the following policy to your IAM user:
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "polly:SynthesizeSpeech",
           "polly:DescribeVoices"
         ],
         "Resource": "*"
       }
     ]

- **Build Tool**: Vite

## Production Deployment

1. **Deploy to Supabase:**
